# Image Steganography Program

This project is an **image steganography application** that allows users to **encode and decode messages inside images**.  
It supports multiple encryption algorithms, including **AES**, **DES**, and **XOR**, to secure the hidden data before embedding it into images.

Users can hide confidential messages within image files and later retrieve them safely, combining **cryptography** and **steganography** for secure and hidden communication.

## Features
- Encode messages into images
- Decode hidden messages from images
- Supports AES, DES, and XOR encryption
